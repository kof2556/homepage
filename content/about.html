<p> My name is Kendyl Fento and I have been blessing this beautiful earth for 29 years now. Originally from New Orleans aka The Big Easy, I graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette(Go Ragin Cajuns) with a Bachelors Degree in Criminal Justice. After I joined the United States Marine Corp and served unforgetable years. When I finished, i recieved a phone call from my brother about the bay area and before I knew, my bags were packed and on my way to Oakland. While living in the bay area, I came to realize that my heart was not in Criminal Justice and soon I began to search for something else. After searching, looking, and numerous job interviews I came across an add to go to a coding class and decided that it wouldnt hurt to see what it was about. After the class I realized how much fun I had and from then on knew what I wanted to do. After a little more research and a few more classes, I enrolled myself in KickStart Coding and began my carreer towards becoming a coder. </p>
