              </h2>
              <p class="juice">Going into Week 1, I was pretty excited to begin this new chapter of my life. That excitement turned into fear after the first day, adjusting to the fast pace evironment of the class was giving me nightmares. Being in a class room environment, sometimes people will not ask any questions, just because nobody else is. This was something I did on the first day, but soon had to put my pride aside to get the answers to my questions. Stressing only after the third class about the homework and a quiz on monday, I realized I had some doubts in my mind on whether the class was for me. Still I fought on though, coming into the next class early to get some extra help and look over material for the quiz. After having a conversation with both of the instructors, I felt a bit of relief and a weight lifted off of me. Maybe I will be able to make it through. We'll See! Come back next week to see if I passed the quiz and also for what happens in Week 2, Its sure to be a wild ride.</p>
