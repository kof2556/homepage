<p class="mb-0"><span class="juice">As Bay area residents, we all know that there is high percentage of people who are not from here originally. People flock from all over the world to come and live in this Beautiful area. Some people come for the weather, some come for the tech industry, others come for the jaw dropping views. Whatever the reason, we all were that new person in the bay. When being a newbie in this vast area, figuring out everything can be quite overwhelmig, so we decided to try and help you out by creating an informative website of the bay area, starting right here with Oakland. With the launch of this wedpage we hope to bring you the latest in restaurants, lake events, clothing and art stores, concerts, and of course night life. Our mission is to make even first timers to the area on top of whats happening in our great town and give everyone the experience they deserve when being in Oakland. </span></p>
