              </h2>
              <p class="blogger">Going into Week 1, I was pretty excited to begin this new chapter of my life. That excitement turned into fear after the first day, adjusting to the fast pace evironment of the class was giving me nightmares. Being in a class room environment, sometimes people will not ask any questions, just because nobody else is. This was something I did on the first day, but soon had to put my pride aside to get the answers to my questions. Stressing only after the third class about the homework and a quiz on monday, I realized I had some doubts in my mind on whether the class was for me. Still I fought on though, coming into the next class early to get some extra help and look over material for the quiz. After having a conversation with both of the instructors, I felt a bit of relief and a weight lifted off of me. Maybe I will be able to make it through. We'll See! Come back next week to see if I passed the quiz and also for what happens in Week 2, Its sure to be a wild ride.</p>

   <p class="mb-0"><span class="yea">As Bay area residents, we all know that there is high percentage of people who are not from here originally. People flock from all over the world to come and live in this Beautiful area. Some people come for the weather, some come for the tech industry, others come for the jaw dropping views. Whatever the reason, we all were that new person in the bay. When being a newbie in this vast area, figuring out everything can be quite overwhelmig, so we decided to try and help you out by creating an informative website of the bay area, starting right here with Oakland. With the launch of this wedpage we hope to bring you the latest in restaurants, lake events, clothing and art stores, concerts, and of course night life.

   <!-- about me -->
    <p> My name is Kendyl Fento and I have been blessing this beautiful earth for 29 years now. Originally from New Orleans aka The Big Easy, I graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette(Go Ragin Cajuns) with a Bachelors Degree in Criminal Justice. After I joined the United States Marine Corp and served unforgetable years. When I finished, i recieved a phone call from my brother about the bay area and before I knew, my bags were packed and on my way to Oakland. While living in the bay area, I came to realize that my heart was not in Criminal Justice and soon I began to search for something else. After searching, looking, and numerous job interviews I came across an add to go to a coding class and decided that it wouldnt hurt to see what it was about. After the class I realized how much fun I had and from then on knew what I wanted to do. After a little more research and a few more classes, I enrolled myself in KickStart Coding and began my carreer towards becoming a coder. </p>
